# PLACEHOLDER ICON FILES

# Replace these with your actual app icons:
# 
# 1. app_icon.png (1024x1024 recommended)
#    - This will be used for both Android and iOS app icons
# 
# 2. app_icon_foreground.png (432x432 recommended for adaptive icons)
#    - Foreground layer for Android adaptive icons
# 
# 3. splash_logo.png (512x512 recommended)
#    - Logo for splash screen (white logo on transparent background works best)
